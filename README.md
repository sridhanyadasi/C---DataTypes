# C---DataTypes

This repository contains simple C programs that explain
the concept of data types and how different types of data
are stored and printed in C programming.

What is a Data Type?

A data type specifies:

the type of value a variable can store

the amount of memory allocated

the operations that can be performed on the data

In simple words:
Data types tell the compiler what kind of data we are using.

Why We Use Data Types?

To store different kinds of data (numbers, characters, decimals)

To use memory efficiently

To avoid type-related errors

To perform correct operations on variables

Data Types Covered in This Repository

int – stores whole numbers

float – stores decimal values

double – stores large decimal values

char – stores a single character

short – stores small integer values

long – stores large integer values

Important Notes

C does not have a separate byte data type
→ unsigned char is used as a byte

C does not have a built-in boolean data type
→ int is used (0 = false, 1 = true)

Each data type must be printed using the correct format specifier

What You Will Learn

How to declare variables with different data types

How to assign values correctly

How to print values using printf

Common mistakes and how to fix them

Purpose of This Repository

To understand data types clearly

To practice basic C programs
