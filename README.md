# C Data Types 

This repository contains simple and beginner-friendly C programs
to understand **data types** and how to print their values using
correct `printf` format specifiers.

---

## 🔹 What are Data Types?

Data types define:
- what type of value a variable can store
- how much memory is allocated
- what kind of operations can be performed

In simple words:
**Data types tell the compiler what type of data we are using.**

---

## 🔹 Why We Use Data Types?

- To store different kinds of data (numbers, characters, decimals)
- To use memory efficiently
- To avoid errors during execution
- To perform correct operations on variables

## 🔹 Common Data Types in C

| Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `int`     | Stores whole numbers |
| `float`   | Stores decimal values |
| `double`  | Stores large decimal values |
| `char`    | Stores a single character |
| `short`   | Stores small integer values |
| `long`    | Stores large integer values |

## 🔹 Note on Byte and Boolean

- C does **not** have a separate `byte` data type  
  👉 `unsigned char` is used as a byte

- C does **not** have a boolean data type  
  👉 `int` is used (`0` = false, `1` = true)

---

## 🔹 Example Program Included

- Printing integer, float, double, char values
- Using correct `printf` format specifiers
- Understanding common mistakes and fixes

---

🔹 Purpose of This Repository

To understand data types clearly in C
To practice using different data types
To observe correct output and common errors
To learn proper usage of printf format specifiers
To build strong fundamentals in C programming
